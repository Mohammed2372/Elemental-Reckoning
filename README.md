# Elemental Reckoning
## Game Overview

Elemental Reckoning is a single-player 2D action-adventure game where you embark on a quest to collect ten legendary elemental stones. Each stone grants control over a powerful force‚ÄîFire, Wind, Earth, Water and more. You begin by choosing one stone, which defines your unique starting abilities and combat style.

The remaining nine stones are guarded by powerful, corrupted elemental bosses scattered across the world. To reclaim each stone, you must defeat its guardian in intense, element-themed battles, overcoming their unique attacks and environments. Once a new stone is acquired, you can equip and switch between any of the collected stones‚Äîbut only one elemental power can be used at a time, requiring strategic choices before each mission or challenge.

Explore diverse elemental realms, face off against enemies aligned with each element, and grow stronger as you collect more stones. With no hybrid abilities or combinations, mastering each stone's individual strengths and knowing when to use them is key to your survival.
